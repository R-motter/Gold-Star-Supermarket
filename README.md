# Gold Star Supermarket - Java OOP Project

This is a small Java console application built as part of a Coursera tutorial on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It demonstrates basic OOP concepts such as classes, constructors, instance variables, and methods through a simple supermarket app.  
This project serves as a starting point, and more features may be added in the future.

## Features

- Multiple product types (e.g., Grocery, Beverage, Dairy) represented by classes
- Calculates actual product prices with discounts
- Creates example products and displays their prices in the console

## How to Run

1. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
2. Locate the `Main` class, which contains the `main` method.
3. Run the `Main` class:
    - In your IDE: right-click `Main` â†’ **Run**
    - Or via command line:
      ```bash
      javac *.java
      java Main
      ```  
4. The console will display example products and their total price.
